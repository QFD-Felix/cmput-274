Code running instruction:
In this excerise I wrote a program that uses both the joystick and your display. I used both cursor program and simpleimage program that we built during the class to help me to accomplish this excerise. In my code the first void function setputed the SD card and the arduino. This function also setted the black color as background and drew the small edmonton map above the background. In the scanJoystick function, I used if else statement to set the deadzon and boundaries of joystick. These would make joystick stop when joystick hits the map's boundaries. Also the joystick will not move when nobody is touching it. In updateScreen function, I drew a 3x3 square, and in order to cover the trail of the cursor, I redrew the picture where the cursor passes. In side the main function, I used build in function millis() to make the cursor move at a constant and controllable speed.
