Makefile:
In Makefile, I used the one we create in the class. However, it will
not work since the name of the file did not mach. So I changed the file
name and deleted other useless file name. Right now, the make file
would have objects and project name : new_example and these objects, 
project are related to new_example.cpp file. At the end of the make 
file, I used "@rm $(OBJECTS) $(PROJECT) -f" so the program could run 
again after inputing "./f". 

Cpp file:
In this program, I read the input using cin>>, and calculated the 
length of string. Then I used for loop to check whether the input is 
pure digit. Since the atoi() function could only convert a character 
arry into an integer, I converted the string into an character array. 
By using the atoi() function I get the integer, then checked wether 
the integer is zero or not. After the checking, print the output. When 
the array is not pure positive integer, return false, else return 
true. After this I ended the program. Then for the next part, I create 
an new array first. The size of the array equal to the input string. 
The pointer was also assigned for that array. Then I used for loop to 
fill the array with integer from 1 to the integer of the input string. 
After showing the output, I deleted the memories of the new arrays and 
end the program.
